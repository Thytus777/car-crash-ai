# Car Crash AI — Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a **car crash damage detection and assessment AI** built with Python (FastAPI backend) and a Vision LLM for image analysis. The system accepts vehicle images, identifies the vehicle, detects damage per component, scores severity, and estimates repair/replacement costs.

## Architecture

- **Backend:** Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- **AI:** OpenAI GPT-4 Vision (MVP) → custom YOLO models (production)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (MVP) → Next.js (production)
- **Storage:** S3-compatible object storage for images

## Code Conventions

### Python
- Use Python 3.11+ with type hints on all function signatures
- Follow PEP 8 style, enforced by `ruff`
- Use `pydantic` for all data models (request/response schemas)
- Use `async def` for all FastAPI route handlers
- Organize imports: stdlib → third-party → local (enforced by ruff isort)
- Use `pathlib.Path` over `os.path`
- Environment variables via `pydantic-settings` (never hardcode secrets)

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints under `/api/v1/`
- Return structured JSON with consistent error format: `{"detail": "message"}`
- Use HTTP status codes correctly (200, 201, 400, 422, 500)
- All endpoints must have OpenAPI descriptions

### Testing
- Use `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio` for async tests
- Test files mirror source structure: `app/services/foo.py` → `tests/test_foo.py`
- Use `httpx.AsyncClient` for API endpoint tests
- Minimum: test all API endpoints and service-layer functions

### AI / Prompts
- Store all LLM prompts as constants in dedicated prompt files (e.g., `prompts/damage_assessment.py`)
- Always request structured JSON output from Vision LLMs
- Include the expected JSON schema in every prompt
- Log all LLM inputs/outputs for debugging (redact any PII)

### Data Models
- Severity scores are always `float` in range `[0.0, 1.0]`
- Cost values are `Decimal` with 2 decimal places (never `float` for money)
- Vehicle identification: `make`, `model`, `year` (int), `trim` (optional)
- All damage assessments reference a standard component list (see PROJECT_PLAN.md §3)

## File Structure Rules

- `backend/app/api/routes/` — API endpoint definitions only (thin controllers)
- `backend/app/services/` — Business logic (damage detection, cost estimation, etc.)
- `backend/app/models/` — Pydantic models and DB schemas
- `backend/app/core/` — Configuration, security, shared utilities
- `backend/tests/` — All tests
- `ml/` — ML training scripts and notebooks (Phase 3)

## Security

- Never commit API keys or secrets — use `.env` files (git-ignored)
- Validate all uploaded files: check MIME type, file size, image dimensions
- Rate-limit image upload endpoints
- Sanitize all user input before passing to LLM prompts

## Git Workflow

- **Always ask the user for approval before any git operation** (commit, push, merge, branch creation, etc.)
- **Branching model:** Git Flow with `develop` as the integration branch
  - All feature branches are created from `develop`
  - Branch naming: `feature/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/image-upload`, `feature/vehicle-identification`)
  - Merge back into `develop` **only when the user confirms** the feature is complete and verified
  - Never merge directly into `main` — `main` is for production releases only
- **Commits:** Use conventional commit messages (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`)
- **Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`** — only stage files directly related to the current task

## Learning & Reference

- **`LEARNING.md`** — Comprehensive guide to all technologies, concepts, and patterns used in this project. Covers FastAPI, Pydantic, OpenAI Vision LLM integration, prompt engineering, image processing, the live price search pipeline, async programming, testing, and AI model selection with cost comparisons. **Read this file when onboarding or when you need to understand why a technology choice was made.**

## Key Decision Records

- **Severity threshold 0.3** — Damage > 0.3 recommends replacement; ≤ 0.3 recommends repair
- **Vision LLM first** — Use GPT-4 Vision for MVP to avoid training data requirements
- **Static price DB for MVP** — Real parts API integration deferred to Phase 2
- **Labor rate default** — $75/hr national average until regional rates are implemented
